# PatentForge — Project Bootstrap

## UI/QA Gate — Hard Rule

Every frontend change requires browser-verified QA before commit. No exceptions.

1. **Every implementation plan** that touches frontend code MUST include explicit numbered QA tasks: browser check of every rendered state, viewport check at desktop and mobile, accessibility audit, copy review, browser console check. These are plan tasks with the same enforcement as code tasks — not a post-build afterthought.
2. **Before any frontend commit**, you MUST have browser screenshots or console output from the current session proving you checked the rendered output. No browser evidence = no commit.
3. **Every error, warning, and empty state** MUST be actionable — tell the user what's wrong AND how to fix it with specific steps. A warning without a fix path is a dead end.

## What This Is

PatentForge is a full-lifecycle patent analysis web platform being built from scratch. Read these files first:

1. **This file** — operational context, file locations, build instructions
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** — system design, database schema, service specs, UX wireframes
3. **PRD.md** — product requirements, priorities, release phases, API spec

## Current Phase: v0.1 (MVP Web Feasibility Analyzer)

Build a web-based patent feasibility analyzer that replaces the existing Windows-only WPF desktop app. This involves:

1. Use **AutoBE** to generate the central NestJS + Prisma backend (project CRUD, feasibility run tracking, settings, SSE events)
2. **Port** the existing C# patent analysis pipeline to TypeScript (6-stage Anthropic streaming pipeline)
3. Build a **React frontend** using the AutoBE-generated type-safe SDK
4. Wire it all together with **Docker Compose**

## Build Instructions: v0.1

### Step 1: Generate the Central Backend with AutoBE

**Goal**: Use AutoBE to generate a NestJS + Prisma backend with these capabilities:
- Project CRUD (create, list, get, delete patent projects)
- Invention input (11-field disclosure form, linked to project)
- Feasibility run tracking (versioned runs with 6 stages each)
- Settings management (API key, model selection, tokens, delays)
- SSE endpoint for real-time pipeline events

**How**:
1. Extract `C:\Users\scott\Downloads\autobe-main.zip`
2. `cd` into the extracted directory, run `pnpm install`
3. Create an AutoBE agent instance (see ARCHITECTURE.md §2.2 for the schema to describe)
4. Feed it the requirements below as a conversation prompt
5. Collect the generated files via `agent.getFiles({ phase: "realize", dbms: "postgres" })`

**AutoBE requirements prompt** (feed this to the agent):
```
I need a backend for a patent analysis platform called PatentForge.

Data models:
- Project: id (uuid), title (string), status (enum: INTAKE, FEASIBILITY, PRIOR_ART, DRAFTING, COMPLIANCE, APPLICATION, FILED, ABANDONED), createdAt, updatedAt
- InventionInput: id, projectId (unique FK to Project), title, description, problemSolved, howItWorks, aiComponents, threeDPrintComponents, whatIsNovel, currentAlternatives, whatIsBuilt, whatToProtect, additionalNotes — all string fields, only title and description required
- FeasibilityRun: id, projectId (FK), version (int), status (enum: PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETE, ERROR, CANCELLED, STALE), startedAt, completedAt, finalReport (text nullable)
- FeasibilityStage: id, feasibilityRunId (FK), stageNumber (int 1-6), stageName (string), status (same enum as run), outputText (text nullable), model (string nullable), webSearchUsed (boolean default false), startedAt, completedAt, errorMessage (string nullable)
- AppSettings: id (default "singleton"), anthropicApiKey (string), defaultModel (string default "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"), researchModel (string default ""), maxTokens (int default 32000), interStageDelaySeconds (int default 5)

API endpoints:
- POST /projects — create project (title required)
- GET /projects — list all projects with status
- GET /projects/:id — get project with invention, latest feasibility run, and its stages
- DELETE /projects/:id — cascade delete project and all related data
- PUT /projects/:id/invention — create or update invention disclosure
- GET /projects/:id/invention — get invention disclosure
- POST /projects/:id/feasibility/run — create a new feasibility run (increments version)
- GET /projects/:id/feasibility — get latest feasibility run with stages
- GET /projects/:id/feasibility/:version — get specific version
- PATCH /projects/:id/feasibility/stages/:stageNumber — update a stage (status, outputText, model, etc.)
- POST /projects/:id/feasibility/cancel — set running feasibility run to CANCELLED
- GET /settings — get app settings
- PUT /settings — update app settings

The project status should default to INTAKE on creation and update to FEASIBILITY when a feasibility run starts.

Use PostgreSQL with Prisma. Generate full NestJS controllers, services, and modules. Include E2E tests and a type-safe SDK.
```

**Alternative if AutoBE is too complex to set up**: Build the backend manually using NestJS + Prisma following the schema in ARCHITECTURE.md. The schema is fully specified there.

### Step 2: Port the Feasibility Service

**Goal**: Standalone TypeScript HTTP server that runs the 6-stage patent analysis pipeline.

**Port these files** (read them from `reference/patent-analyzer-app/`):

| C# Source | TypeScript Target | What to Do |
|-----------|------------------|-----------|
| `PromptTemplates.cs` | `services/feasibility/src/prompts/stage-1.md` through `stage-6.md` + `common-rules.md` | Extract the 6 system prompt strings and the common rules prefix into separate markdown files. Each prompt is a string constant in the C# file (Stage1SystemPrompt through Stage6SystemPrompt). The common rules are prepended to each. |
| `AnthropicClient.cs` | `services/feasibility/src/anthropic-client.ts` | Port the SSE streaming client. Key behaviors: POST to api.anthropic.com/v1/messages with stream:true, parse `data:` lines, handle content_block_delta (text_delta) events, detect web_search tool use (server_tool_use block type), retry on 429/502/503 with delays [60s, 90s, 120s], support CancellationToken → AbortController. |
| `PipelineRunner.cs` | `services/feasibility/src/pipeline-runner.ts` | Port the orchestrator. Key behaviors: run 6 stages sequentially, each stage gets system prompt + user message built from all previous outputs (see BuildUserMessage method), emit events (stage_start, token, stage_complete, pipeline_complete), inter-stage delay, cancellation support. |
| `AnalysisModels.cs` | `services/feasibility/src/models.ts` | Port InventionInput (with ToNarrative method), StageResult, AnalysisResult, StageDefinition, AppSettings. Use TypeScript interfaces. |
| `ReportExporter.cs` | `services/feasibility/src/report-exporter.ts` | Port markdown + HTML export. The C# version saves timestamped folders with individual stage .md files + final report .md + .html. |

**Feasibility service API** (Express or Fastify):
```
POST /analyze
Body: { inventionNarrative: string, settings: { model, researchModel, maxTokens, interStageDelaySeconds, apiKey } }
Response: SSE stream

Events:
  event: stage_start\ndata: {"stage":1,"name":"Technical Intake & Restatement"}\n\n
  event: token\ndata: {"text":"Based on..."}\n\n
  event: stage_complete\ndata: {"stage":1,"output":"...full text...","model":"claude-sonnet-4-20250514","webSearchUsed":false}\n\n
  ... (stages 2-6) ...
  event: pipeline_complete\ndata: {"finalReport":"...","stages":[...]}\n\n
  event: error\ndata: {"stage":2,"message":"Rate limited after 3 retries"}\n\n
```

### Step 3: Build the Adapter

**Goal**: Connect the AutoBE-generated backend to the feasibility service.

Create `backend/src/adapters/feasibility.adapter.ts` that:
1. Receives a "run feasibility" request from the backend controller
2. Reads the project's InventionInput from the database
3. Calls InventionInput.toNarrative() to build the combined narrative
4. Calls the feasibility service at `FEASIBILITY_URL` (env var, default http://localhost:3001)
5. Parses the SSE stream
6. On each `stage_complete` event: writes/updates the FeasibilityStage row in the database
7. On `pipeline_complete`: updates the FeasibilityRun with finalReport and status=COMPLETE
8. Forwards all events to the frontend via the backend's own SSE endpoint

### Step 4: Build the React Frontend

**Goal**: Web UI for invention intake, pipeline execution, and report viewing.

**Pages**:

1. **Project List** (`/`)
   - List of all projects with title, status, created date
   - "New Project" button
   - Click project → project detail

2. **Project Detail** (`/projects/:id`)
   - Left sidebar: pipeline stage indicators (intake/feasibility status)
   - Main area: changes based on current stage
   - If INTAKE: show invention form
   - If FEASIBILITY running: show streaming output + stage progress
   - If FEASIBILITY complete: show rendered report

3. **Invention Form** (`/projects/:id/intake`)
   - 11 fields (Title and Description required, 9 optional expandable)
   - Save Draft button
   - Run Feasibility button (creates run, starts pipeline)

4. **Feasibility View** (`/projects/:id/feasibility`)
   - Left panel: stage list with status icons (pending/running/complete/error)
   - Right panel: streaming markdown output (current stage)
   - When complete: final report rendered with export buttons
   - Cancel button while running

5. **Settings** (`/settings`)
   - Anthropic API Key (password field, stored encrypted)
   - Default Model (dropdown: claude-sonnet-4-20250514, claude-opus-4-20250514, claude-haiku-4-5-20251001)
   - Research Model (optional, for Stage 2 cost optimization)
   - Max Tokens (number input, default 32000)
   - Inter-Stage Delay (number input, default 5 seconds)

**Tech**: React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS. Use the AutoBE-generated SDK for API calls if available, otherwise use fetch directly.

### Step 5: Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
    depends_on: [postgres]
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://patentforge:patentforge@postgres:5432/patentforge
      FEASIBILITY_URL: http://feasibility:3001
  feasibility:
    build: ./services/feasibility
    ports: ["3001:3001"]
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: patentforge
      POSTGRES_USER: patentforge
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: patentforge
    volumes: ["pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data"]
    ports: ["5432:5432"]
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
    depends_on: [backend]
volumes:
  pgdata:
```

## Key Porting Notes

### PromptTemplates.cs → Markdown Files

The C# file contains string constants like:
```csharp
public static string Stage1SystemPrompt => CommonRules + @"...stage 1 specific prompt...";
```

Extract each into a separate .md file. The `CommonRules` string should become `common-rules.md`, loaded and prepended to each stage prompt at runtime. This allows prompt iteration without recompilation — a direct improvement over the C# approach.

### AnthropicClient.cs → TypeScript

Key differences from C# to TypeScript:
- `HttpClient` → `fetch` with `ReadableStream`
- SSE parsing: read lines from the response body stream, look for `data: ` prefix
- `CancellationToken` → `AbortController` / `AbortSignal`
- The C# client handles `content_block_start` with type `server_tool_use` to detect web search — preserve this
- Retry on 429 (TooManyRequests), 502, 503 with delays [60000, 90000, 120000] ms

### PipelineRunner.cs → TypeScript

Key behaviors to preserve:
- Sequential stage execution (stages 1→2→3→4→5→6, no parallelism)
- Each stage's user message is built by `BuildUserMessage()` which concatenates all previous stage outputs (see the switch statement in the C# source for the exact format per stage)
- Stage 2 can use a different (cheaper) model via `researchModel` setting
- Inter-stage delay (default 5s) between stages for rate limit protection
- Events: `OnStageStart`, `OnToken`, `OnStageComplete`, `OnPipelineComplete`, `OnStageError`
- Cancellation support at any point

## What NOT to Build in v0.1

- Prior art search (PQAI integration) → v0.2
- Claim drafting → v0.4
- Compliance checking → v0.5
- Application generation → v0.6
- Multi-user auth → not yet scoped
- The database schema can include placeholder tables for future services, but don't build adapters, UIs, or services for them yet

## Testing v0.1

1. `docker compose up` should start all 4 services (backend, feasibility, postgres, frontend)
2. Open http://localhost:8080 → see empty project list
3. Create a new project → fill in invention form → save
4. Click "Run Feasibility" → see streaming output with stage progress
5. Wait for all 6 stages → see final report rendered as markdown
6. Export as HTML → verify styled output
7. Go back to project list → project shows status FEASIBILITY with completion date
8. Settings page → change model → re-run → verify new model used

## Cost Estimates

- AutoBE generation: ~$5-$15 one-time (30M-250M tokens depending on schema complexity)
- Feasibility analysis per invention: ~$0.75-$3.00 (Sonnet pricing, 6 stages, ~50K-200K tokens total)
- Haiku for Stage 2 (research model): reduces per-analysis cost to ~$0.50-$1.50
